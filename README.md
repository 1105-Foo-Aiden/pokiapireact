Peer reviewer: Zachary Dressel
Peer Review: Website uses Typescript and is a decent recreation of the original page. Favorites does not work but adding and removing a favorite does. Overall good!

Description:
I have no idea how I broke the API call but the call doesn't woork the first time you try, then the evo and location data don't populate on the second time you try to call it. Then on the thrid call, the location and evolution data populate, but are one pokemon behind somehow.
That's about all I could get
